I'm a software engineer who loves coding, writing, and research. I'm currently working on a flightlog app for my capstone project with the Marcy LAb School. Recently, I've been actively looking for work in the space-tech field to get an opportunity to work on space technologies. However, I'm open to work and build skills in my software engineering profession with any comapny. I reference the word astrophysical in my banner to acknowledge my need to be aprt of cutting-edge work and research. It is most statisfying to get to learn and work on new things!!!!ðŸ”­
